# FlightBookingSystem
The project FlightBookingSystem (FBS) is about booking a flight seat where a user can book a flight ticket either in Business class or Economy class based on his/her choice. Also, after booking the user can also find the booking details like (Seat No, Booking ID, Passenger Name etc) of his/her seat. Users can also cancel the ticket after booking.
